                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>MANIT was started in 1960 as Maulana Azad College of Technology (MACT), named after the first Minister of Education of India, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. MACT started functioning in 1960 at Govt S.V. Polytechnic with an intake of 120 students and seven faculty members. It was one of the first eight Regional Engineering Colleges started during the second five-year plan (1956-1960) in India, where the main focus was development of the public sector and rapid industrialization.
                        The institute was named after Maulana Abul Kalam Azad
                        
                        <p> ensure enough supply of trained personnel to meet the demand for these projects, a decision was taken to start the Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs), at the rate of one per each major state, which can churn out graduates with good engineering merit. Thus, seventeen RECs were established from 1959 onwards in each of the major states. Each college was a joint and cooperative enterprise of the central government and the concerned state government. MACT was one of the first 8 REC's to be established in each region in India. It was established in the Western Region along with Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur and Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, Surat.
                        </p>
                        It first operated from the Swami Vivekananda Polytechnic with Mr.S.R. Beedkar, Principal of Swami Vivekananda Polytechnic as the planning officer of the institute. The foundation stone of the Institute building was laid by the then Prime Minister late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on 23 April 1961. The Institute Progressed into the higher level of an education center in the steady development of infrastructure as well as academics. Shri J.N.Moudgill became the first principal of MACT in 1962. 5-years degree program in Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering was started. In 1963, the five-year Bachelor of Architecture was started as well. In 1964, Institute is shifted to its own building which is its present campus. As the necessity of science and technology kept on growing, more undergraduate program kept on getting added which were- Electronics and Communications Engineering in 1972, Computer Science and Engineering in 1986, Information Technology in 2001 (later merged with Computer Science and Engineering in 2013 and 3-year Master of Computer Applications (MCA) in 1988.
                        
                        The success of technology-based industry led to high demand for technical and scientific education. During the Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Minister of Human Resource Development, Murli Manohar Joshi decided to upgrade all "Regional Engineering Colleges" to "National Institutes of Technology" that shall be funded by the Central Government itself. Hence, in 2002, all REC's became NIT's and MACT became Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (MANIT). In the same year, MANIT was granted deemed university status. With this advancement, the World Bank assisted "Technical Education Quality Improvement Program" started in 2003, for the rapid academic and infrastructural growth of the college. In addition to engineering programs, an MBA program as well commenced from 2006. The Government of India in 2007 passed the NIT Act as per which MANIT was declared an Institute of National Importance</p>
